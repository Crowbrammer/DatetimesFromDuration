# DatetimesFromDuration
To make schedules with durations (for tasks), you need two of the three pieces of the puzzle: duration, start time, and end time. The user provides the duration, the time the duration is submitted provides the start time, and this thing creates the end time from these two. I've needed this in many projects, so I've made a separate project for it.
